# Gorillavid New-Tab Pwner

## Intro

[Gorillavid.in](gorillavid.in) is a famous video distribution platform that hosts content for websites such as [putlocker.is](putlocker.is) and [the-watch-series.to](the-watch-series.to).

Being such an awesome website that provides such an awesome service, I accept they need to support themselves and make money. But I'm not very fond of ads. I especially hate the new tab redirection.

## What does this extension do?

I wanted to try making a Chrome Extension and I must say it was pretty fun. I would have loved if the documenation was more human-friendly, but it was not too bad all in all.

The extension closes the Gorillavid extra ad tab every time it opens. Making the experience a little better for you.

## Technical aspects

Built on: _Google Chrome 51_
Language: _Javascript_

Learned about Chrome Extension development. Can now proudly claim to have written a Chrome Extension. Used **localStorage**, _Event Listeners(onUpdate)_**, and *Chrome Extension icon badge creation*!

## P.S.

Sorry Gorillavid.
