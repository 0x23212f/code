# Playing with Python - Multiply Pairs of Integers

- Input file starts with a digit that mentions how many lines follow
- Each line has a pair of ints of range -2<sup>20</sup> <= A,B <= 2<sup>20</sup> 
- Compute product of each lines pair

Bleugh. Not too difficult with Python.

In C/C++ though, you'd have to use *long long int* to store 64-bit ints which should be big enough for the given problem statement.
